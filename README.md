# Skynet-todo-list

Small To-Do List application to test out the Skynet platform. Skynet allows you to store your files across a decentralized network of hosts, providing increased censorship resistance and potentially better throughput when compared with alternative solutions like AWS. Skynet is built on top of the Sia (Siacoin) network.

The app is live at

I used some code from the Skynet tutorial and Christina Kopecky at the educative.io website.
